MARKDOWN DOCS

- Markdown files are always stored in `src/docs/**/*.md`.
- Markdown files are declared, validated, and processed in the `src/server/plugins/md-docs/**/*.ts` plugin.
- Markdown files can contain frontmatter that:
- contains SEO metadata via `title`, `description`, `tags`, `date`, `image`, and `meta`
- contains cache data that is used to set route options cache as defined by `RouteOptionsCache` interface in `@hapi/hapi`
- contains `httpHeaders` data that is used to set response `httpHeaders`
- contains `layout` data that is used to set the layout for the page
- can be published or not via `published` boolean
- can be future-dated via `date`
- is flagged as `updatedAt` by either `date` or the file's last modified date, whichever is more recent.
